# Binary Search Algorithm

This is a Python program that implements the binary search algorithm to find the index of a target element in a sorted list of integers.

## Features

- Performs a binary search on a sorted list to find the index of the target element.
- Displays the steps of the search process, showing the sub-list being examined at each step.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Program:**
   - Execute the script in a Python environment.

2. **Input Instructions:**
   - Enter a list of sorted integers separated by spaces when prompted.
   - Enter the target number you want to search for.

3. **Output:**
   - The program will perform the binary search and display the steps of the search process.
   - If the target element is found, it will display the index where it was found.
   - If the target element is not found, it will display a message indicating that.

## Example

Enter numbers with spaces: 10 20 30 40 50<br>
Enter the target number: 30<br>
Step 1: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]<br>
Step 2: [30, 40, 50]<br>
Element is found at index 2

## Error Handling

- The program handles invalid input by displaying an error message and prompting the user to enter valid numbers.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
